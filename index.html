      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Deck of Cards Workout: Evolved is a fitness app. I do not collect, store, or have access to any personal data from you through the app.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app and when Google shows ads in the app in the future.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of this policy, I act as the data controller for any data that would be collected through the app, other than data collected directly by Google or other third‑party providers under their own policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Data Collected</h2>
      <p><strong>Collected by me:</strong> None. The app does not create accounts, track usage on a personal basis, or store personal information on my servers (I don’t run any).</p>
      <p><strong>Collected by Google AdMob (for ads):</strong> If and when I enable AdMob banner ads in the app, Google AdMob may collect certain information from your device to be able to serve and measure ads. This can include mobile advertising identifiers, IP address, app usage information (such as which screens are viewed and how often), and information about your interactions with ads. This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
      <p>The app is currently configured to request only <strong>non‑personalized ads</strong>. That means Google uses contextual information (such as the content of the app and general information about your device) rather than a detailed personal profile to select ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
      <p>AdMob data is used by Google to deliver, maintain, and measure ads within the app. I do not use or access this data for any other purpose, and I do not combine it with any other information to identify you personally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>I do not share personal data with third parties. Any data related to ads is handled directly by Google AdMob and its partners in accordance with their own policies.</p>
      <p>Data processed by Google AdMob may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your country. These transfers are managed by Google under their own legal and contractual safeguards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>I do not retain your personal data. AdMob retains data for as long as necessary for advertising and reporting purposes, as described in Google’s retention policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>This app is not directed to children under 13. Ad settings are intended to reflect that it is a general‑audience fitness app.</p>
      <p>I do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, please contact me at the email above and I will delete that information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can limit ad tracking in your device settings (for example, “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” on Android).</li>
        <li>You can review and manage Google ad personalization at <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/">https://myadcenter.google.com/</a>.</li>
        <li>You can choose not to use the app if you do not agree with how ads are delivered and measured.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Third‑Party Services and Links</h2>
      <p>The app and this Privacy Policy may contain links to third‑party websites or services (such as Google’s privacy and ad settings pages). I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties, and you should review their policies separately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The app does not transmit personal data to me. AdMob traffic is handled by Google over standard encrypted channels. While I strive to use reasonable means to protect information handled through the app, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>If this Privacy Policy changes, I will update this page with the new effective date. Continued use of the app after changes are posted will mean that you accept the updated policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how data is handled in the app, please email <a href="mailto:ddp_fitness_assistance@outlook.com">ddp_fitness_assistance@outlook.com</a>.</p>
